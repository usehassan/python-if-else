This project contains two simple Python programs:

1. Leap Year Check:
   A program that determines whether a year is a leap year or not based on specific rules.

2. Fizz Buzz Game:
   An interactive game that prints numbers from 1 to n with certain numbers replaced by words.

Task 1: Leap Year Check

Rules:
# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
# It is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Task 2: Fizz Buzz Game

Rules:
# Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
# Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
# Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
# Otherwise, print the number itself.
